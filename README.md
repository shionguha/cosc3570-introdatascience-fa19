Abstract:

Seeing as it is nearly impossible to know what the real cost of attending a postsecondary institution is withoutinvesting time and money into the application process, I set out to attempt to create a linear regression topredict the cost using theU.S. News and World Report’s available college census data. From this endeavourI found that, of many predictors, the only statistically significant ones were the school’s tuition and thepercentage of the school’s students who are receiving aid. This inability to create accurate predictions is likelydue to three factors: the lack of individual data when trying to create individualized predictions, the countlessconfounding factors, and the inadequacy of theU.S. News and World Report’s college ranking system.
