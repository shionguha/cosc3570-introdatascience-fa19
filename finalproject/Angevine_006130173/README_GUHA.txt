Dr. Guha,

I just wanted to let you know that while I was trying to save my R code,
it was giving me some trouble in terms of saving it as an R file and 
reopening the code in Rstudio. I was able to get it to work on my machine
some of the time, but I'm not sure it will work properly on yours. For
that reason, I am also including a file called Angevine_006130173.txt, which
contains my R code in plain text that can be copy-pasted into Rstudio. 
Additionally, if the R file doesn't open, you should be able to right-click
on it and edit it with Notepad++ in order to get the code.

I apologize for this inconvenience, please reach out if you have any 
questions about my submission.
